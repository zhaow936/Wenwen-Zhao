## Device Fabrication

### üèóÔ∏è Cleanroom Access

- **[RPI Micro and Nanofabrication Cleanroom (MNCR)](https://chips.rpi.edu/facilities-centers)**
- **[Cornell NanoScale Science & Technology Facility (CNF)](https://www.cnf.cornell.edu/)**

We use the RPI cleanroom for in-house device processing and collaborate with CNF.

## Electrical & RF Characterization

- **Room numbers:** JEC 7318, CII 5112  
- **In-house RF measurement setup:** *coming soon*

Our RF capabilities will include high-frequency S-parameter testing, on-wafer probing, and cryogenic measurements to support integrated acoustic-electronic devices.
